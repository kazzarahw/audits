## Description

This is a list of all of my non-private smart contract security audit reports.

This is also going to be where I redo some reports for "fake" contracts (like the [CodeHawks First Flights](https://codehawks.cyfrin.io/first-flights)) as the original reports I wrote for these were very, very poor.

~~This will not include the repos of the smart contracts themselves as `git submodules` has never really been a stable thing to work with in my experience. Maybe I'll change my mind on this in the future but for right now the reports will have the links to the smart contract's repos embedded.~~

On second thought I'm just going to include the submodules. The second it pisses me off, though, they stop.<br>
Your move, `git`.
