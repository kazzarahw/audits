## Description

This is a list of all of my non-private smart contract security audit reports.

This is also going to be where I redo some reports for "fake" contracts (like the [CodeHawks First Flights](https://codehawks.cyfrin.io/first-flights)) as the original reports I wrote for these were very, very poor.

The submodules are not pushed because they are just cloned then built (`forge build`, `make`, etc).<br>
Nothing else is changed.
