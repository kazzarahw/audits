### [H-1] `PasswordStore::s_password` variable is not truely secret

**Description**:

All smart contract state variable are held in `memory`. Meaning, even if the variable is declared `private`, the raw hex value can still be read by anyone as all aspects of the blockchain are transparent.

**Impact**:

Everyone is able to read the contract's password, even without a transaction.

**Proof**:

```bash
make anvil # run Anvil instance
make deploy # deploy PasswordStore to chain
cast storage 0x5FbDB2315678afecb367f032d93F642f64180aa3 1 | cast parse-bytes32-string # get the `s_password` variable as hex then decode it to a string
```

**Patch**:

This likely cannot be fixed with a simple change in the code and would most likely require some sort of off-chain encryption/storage of the password. You could encrypt/decrypt the password on-chain and pass it through a load of obfuscation but, while it will be harder to obtain, the password will likely never truely be secret if everything is done on-chain.
